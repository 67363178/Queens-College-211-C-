1. The program get increasingly slower because it is repeating itself. For example F(5)=F(3)+F(4) and in order to get: f3 we need f2 and f1, f4 we need f3 and f2.
2. we can store it into an array and use it when it is needed.(Memoization)

fib(n){
if(array[n]!=0) return array[n];
array[n]=fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
return array[n];
}

3.a The programe gives you a negative number. It is happening because it is out of range.
  b we can fix it by using type long which have more byte than int.
